Setup [ORAS CLI](https://github.com/oras-project/oras) on GitHub Actions runners.

## Quick Start

Setup the `oras` CLI of the default version:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: oras-project/setup-oras@v1
  - run: oras version
```

## Advanced Usage

Install a specific version of the `oras` CLI by specifying the input `version` without the prefix `v`. Stable versions (not pre-release versions) are supported and can be found at [`oras` releases](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/releases).

For example, install `oras` version `v1.0.0`.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: oras-project/setup-oras@v1
    with:
      version: 1.0.0
  - run: oras version
```

You can also download `oras` CLI from any preferred trusted source, by specifying link of the source via `url` and the SHA256 checksum via `checksum`. This can be used to download a pre-release version or download from a proxy other than `github.com`. 

For example, install `oras` version `v1.2.0-beta.1`.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: oras-project/setup-oras@v1
    with:
      url: https://github.com/oras-project/oras/releases/download/v1.2.0-beta.1/oras_1.2.0-beta.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
      checksum: 37d86f848f7c7c471035cf8218f06372fd72a9fbdca1e10f509738e222b3b2be
  - run: oras version
```
